# üîß Console Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ‚úÖ **Content Security Policy (CSP) Errors**
**Problem:** Analytics scripts (Google Tag Manager, Clarity) and WordPress GraphQL were blocked by CSP
**Solution:** Updated SecurityHeaders.tsx to include:
- Added googletagmanager.com, clarity.ms, and google-analytics.com to script-src
- Added analytics domains to connect-src
- Added frame-src for GTM iframe support

### 2. ‚úÖ **Maximum Update Depth Warning**
**Problem:** useSEO hook was causing infinite re-renders due to passing entire options object as dependency
**Solution:** Updated useSEO.ts to only include specific option properties in useEffect dependency array

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNSAFE_componentWillMount Warning**
**Status:** This is a known issue with react-helmet library
**Note:** This warning doesn't affect functionality but indicates the library uses legacy lifecycle methods
**Future Action:** Consider migrating to react-helmet-async or @react-helmet/helmet

## Remaining Console Output:

After these fixes, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Analytics scripts loading successfully
- ‚úÖ WordPress GraphQL connections working
- ‚úÖ No more infinite render loops
- ‚ö†Ô∏è One deprecation warning from react-helmet (safe to ignore for now)

## To Test:
1. Refresh the browser
2. Check Network tab - analytics scripts should load
3. Check Console - CSP errors should be gone
4. The site should function normally

## Next Steps:
- Monitor analytics to ensure data is being collected
- Consider updating to react-helmet-async in future for cleaner console
- All SEO and performance features should work as expected
