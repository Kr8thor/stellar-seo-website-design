# ðŸ”§ HTACCESS REFRESH FIX

## Issue Identified
When refreshing pages on the React site, the site disappears because the current `.htaccess` file is serving static HTML files to all users instead of letting the React app handle routing.

## Root Cause
The `.htaccess` file had this problematic rule:
```apache
# This serves static HTML files for ALL requests (wrong!)
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}/index.html -f
RewriteRule ^(.*)/?$ $1/index.html [L]
```

This was serving `dist/about/index.html` (static crawler content) to users instead of letting React Router handle the `/about` route.

## Solution Applied
Updated `.htaccess` to follow the "Final Fix" document approach:
- âœ… Serve React app to all users
- âœ… Let JavaScript handle crawler detection (not .htaccess)
- âœ… Static files (assets, sitemap, robots.txt) served directly
- âœ… All other routes go to React app (`/index.html`)

## Expected Result
- âœ… React site works on page refresh
- âœ… Crawlers still get static content via JavaScript detection
- âœ… SEO benefits maintained
- âœ… User experience restored

This fix aligns with the Final Fix document's approach of using JavaScript-based crawler detection instead of server-side content switching.
