          Once upon a time, in the kingdom of the Internet, Google was Macbeth - the conniving king but in-charge nevertheless. You wrote a blog post, sprinkled a few keywords into the bubbling pot like SEO glitter, prayed to the algorithm gods, and waited. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. But the process was predictable, like a bad sitcom with a laugh track: Write good stuff, get traffic, convert visitors, make money.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          That era is officially over. Macbeth is bleeding out on the castle steps. And the assassin? It's ChatGPT. And its friends Gemini, Perplexity, and every other LLM that's rewiring how humans find and trust information.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">RIP Blue Links, Long Live The Prompt</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Google took 13 years to reach a billion users. ChatGPT did it in 2.5. That's not growth. That's a detonation. People are no longer googling "best CRM software." They're telling ChatGPT, "Hey, I run a failing ad agency in Des Moines. Give me three CRMs that won't make me cry blood."
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium mb-8">
          And ChatGPT delivers. Fast. Personalized. No ads. No scrolling. No clickbait. Just answers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">The Buyer Journey Isn't a Funnel Anymore. It's a Slingshot.</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You know how we used to woo leads? Ten-step blog funnels. Lead magnets. Nurture emails that made your soul die a little. Not anymore. Today, users go from "I'm vaguely curious" to "I've picked my vendor" in one conversation with an LLM.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Asia Frost from HubSpot sees this happening constantly. Actual sales calls where prospects say, "ChatGPT told me you were the best, so I'm here. Let's go." If that doesn't make your marketing team panic-laugh, check their pulse.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">LLM Visitors Are 4x More Valuable Than Google Traffic (And Probably Better People Too)</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          SEMrush has data showing that LLM-sourced visitors convert 4 times more than your average organic search clicker. Why? Because these aren't looky-loos. They're pre-qualified by an AI that's already walked them through their problem, vetted options, and nudged them to you.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-4">The New Reality:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-green-800">
            <li>By the time they land on your site, they're ready to talk or buy</li>
            <li>No fluff. No funnel. Just finish the sale.</li>
            <li>Pre-qualified leads with actual intent</li>
            <li>Higher conversion rates across the board</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">Your Website Isn't Being Cited. Reddit Is. So Is Some Random Blog Called Kevin's CRM Cave.</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Here's the bad news: Only 9% of LLM results link to vendor sites. That means your lovingly optimized blog probably isn't showing up. Instead, LLMs cite Reddit threads, aggregator sites, and low-authority blogs that happen to be well-structured, specific, and context-rich.
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium mb-8">
          The good news? This is a reset. You're no longer competing with million-dollar domain authority. You're competing with specificity. LLMs don't care if you're Forbes or Fred's Funnel Factory. They care if your page nails the context of the query.
        </p>

        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581091226825-a6a2a5aee158?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80" alt="Woman working on laptop with AI interface" className="rounded-lg shadow-md my-8 w-full" />

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">You Need 300 Pages. Not 3. And They Need to Say Something Useful.</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          We used to aim for a few high-ranking articles that covered big keywords. Now? You need hyper-specific content at scale. Think: "Best CRM for 3-person construction firms in Alberta struggling with duplicate leads."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          To do that, you need systems. AI-powered ones. You're not going to write 300 high-context pages by hand unless you enjoy wrist pain and existential despair. So build workflows that generate personalized, data-driven content for each persona, each use case.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-8 rounded-r-md">
          <p className="italic text-blue-800">
            And if you're wondering what kind of content LLMs love: they're obsessed with original data. Not just stats from surveys. They want <strong>your</strong> data. Your customer insights. Your real-world outcomes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">SEO Is No Longer About Ranking. It's About Showing Up in AI Answers.</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          HubSpot's growth team is already measuring <strong>visibility</strong> in ChatGPT and Gemini. They're tracking which queries their brand appears in, not how many backlinks they've got. Why? Because when AI is the interface, it doesn't matter what page you're on. It matters if you're in the conversation at all.
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium mb-8">
          The new metric isn't traffic. It's share of voice in AI results.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">And Forget Backlinks. You Need Co-Citations Now.</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          LLMs don't care about anchor text and PageRank. They care if your brand gets mentioned enough in the right context. HubSpot doesn't care about getting links anymore. They care about being named alongside the term "CRM" in every place ChatGPT pulls from.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Your goal is to get your brand mentioned in Reddit, Quora, comparison blogs, and weird niche directories that LLMs love like raccoons love garbage bins.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-amber-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-amber-800 mb-4">Pro tip:</h3>
          <p className="text-amber-800">Use tools like Xfunnel to find out where LLMs are pulling from. Then get yourself in there. Email the site owners. Submit guest content. Bribe them with merch. Just get in the citation pool.</p>

          Let's get one thing straight—if E-E-A-T were a real person, it'd be that coworker who drinks celery juice, runs a weekend startup, volunteers on Tuesdays, and files taxes in January.

        <p className="mb-6">
          You can't fake real-world experience anymore. Google wants to know if the person reviewing camping gear has actually left the house, or if the recipe writer has cooked anything other than toast.

        <p className="mb-6">
          Show, don't tell. Add photos. Add video. Use first-person stories, especially in product reviews or tutorials. If your content reads like it was pulled straight out of ChatGPT's digestive system, you're in trouble.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">Expertise: Knowledge is Currency, But So is Context</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Expertise doesn't always mean having a degree. It means knowing what you're talking about, and being able to prove it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This is where things like author bios, credentials, case studies, and original insights come into play. If you're writing about cybersecurity, you better not be linking to your TikTok where you explain phishing scams with sock puppets—unless you do it really well.
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium mb-8">
          Google is increasingly weighing not just what you say, but who's saying it.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">Authoritativeness: Welcome to the High School Popularity Contest</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Your content might be brilliant, but if no one's referencing you, it doesn't matter. Google trusts sites that others trust. This means backlinks from real websites. Mentions on industry blogs. Social proof. Peer recognition.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's not easy to earn, but here's what helps:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
          <li>Guest contributions on industry blogs</li>
          <li>Being cited in roundups or news articles</li>
          <li>Getting backlinks from real sites (not Fiverr spam farms)</li>
          <li>Publishing original research or data</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Authority is cumulative. It builds slowly—until it doesn't, and you start getting links just for existing.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-4">Trustworthiness: The Most Boring but Crucial Factor</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          This is the unsexy stuff: HTTPS, clear contact info, privacy policies, fast load times, no deceptive ads, and definitely no auto-play audio. It's everything that makes a site feel like it was built by professionals and not by someone with 27 toolbars on their browser.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          If you're dealing with health, finance, or legal topics—anything that falls under "Your Money or Your Life" (YMYL)—Google holds you to an even higher standard. Expect extra scrutiny and act accordingly.

            <li>Build backlinks organically through useful, cite-worthy content.</li>

          E-E-A-T isn't about tricking Google. It's about showing Google that you deserve to rank. That you're helping people. That you're not just part of the noise.

          If you've ever screamed into a Google Doc, "What even works anymore?!"—this one's for you. SEO's been dragged through AI upheavals, algorithm shakeups, and enough SERP drama to fuel a Netflix docuseries. But guess what? Some on-page tactics still hold the line.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          These are the old-school fundamentals with fresh-school relevance. The techniques Google still rewards because—spoiler alert—they're actually helpful to users. So put down your AI content spinner and let's get into the real stuff.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-500 p-4 my-8 rounded-r-md">
          <p className="italic text-amber-800">
            "SEO in 2025 isn't about gaming the system—it's about showing up like a professional with content that helps, structure that guides, and performance that respects the user's time."
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">1. 🔍 Search Intent: The Only Keyword That Matters Is Why</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You can stuff your page with keywords like a piñata full of synonyms, but if you're not matching the reason behind the search, Google will ghost you. In 2025, intent is the algorithm's North Star. People aren't just searching "best protein powder"—they're trying to lose weight, gain muscle, or avoid burping up chalk dust.
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium mb-6">How to win:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
          <li>Answer the real question.</li>
          <li>Anticipate follow-ups.</li>
          <li>Align your tone to the reader's mood (panicked, researching, comparison-shopping, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="font-medium mb-8">Google doesn't want "content"—it wants solutions.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">2. 💬 Schema Markup: Talking to Google in Its Love Language</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Structured data is like putting subtitles on your website. You're not just saying "Here's a recipe." You're saying, "This is a gluten-free lasagna with 1,000 five-star reviews, prep time of 15 mins, and no one cried making it."
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium mb-4">Use it for:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
          <li>Reviews, events, FAQs, products</li>
          <li>Article type, author, and publish dates</li>
          <li>Your ego (via "sameAs" and "author" tags)</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">Result? Rich snippets. Enhanced SERPs. And maybe even your face showing up in Google's fancy answers box.</p>

            <p>We're not talking word count inflation here. Depth means giving a topic the attention it deserves—covering angles your competitors missed, answering the follow-up questions before they're even asked.</p>

            <p>Google's like a curious toddler—it follows links to understand context. Internal linking isn't just about "SEO juice" anymore. It's about building semantic relationships between your ideas.</p>
            <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded">
              <p className="text-gray-700 font-medium">Do this:</p>

          The "set it and forget it" strategy is now "set it and regret it." Your 2021 guide to TikTok ads needs CPR. And Google can smell stale info from a mile away.

        <p className="font-medium mb-4">How to resuscitate content:</p>

            <p>Keywords? Still relevant. But 2025 SEO is about entities—people, places, concepts, and how they all relate.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 font-medium">Think:</p>

            <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded">
              <p className="text-gray-700 font-medium">Fix it:</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">9. 📱 Mobile-First or You're Last</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Google's been mobile-first for years. But now it's mobile-everything. Your beautifully responsive site on desktop doesn't matter if it feels like a Craigslist forum on phones.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-8 rounded-r-md">

        <p className="font-medium mb-4">Your checklist:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
          <li>Large, tap-friendly buttons</li>
          <li>No desktop-style popups</li>
          <li>Font sizes that don't require squinting</li>
          <li>Fast mobile performance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">10. 🤖 AI-Optimized Structure: Write for Readers, Organize for Robots</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          AI-assisted search (hello, SGE) now reads your page like a structured document. You need crystal-clear headings, digestible sections, and logic that even a chatbot can follow.
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium mb-4">Best practices:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
          <li>Use H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy properly</li>
          <li>Front-load value in every paragraph</li>
          <li>Use bullet points like this one</li>
          <li>Make your page skimmable, scrollable, and screenshot-worthy</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">AI doesn't "read"—it parses. Give it clean input, and you'll get clean rankings.</p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Final Thought: SEO That's Worth Clicking</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">On-page SEO in 2025 isn't about "gaming the system." It's about showing up like a professional—with content that helps, structure that guides, and performance that respects the user's time.</p>

          If Google were your gym trainer, Core Web Vitals would be its way of screaming, "No more junk food and janky websites!" In 2025, these three little metrics have gone from "nice-to-have" to non-negotiable. They're the difference between page one glory and page seven purgatory—where even your mom won't find you.

        <p className="mb-6">
          FID is about how responsive your site feels. It's the time between someone clicking something and your site responding.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          If there's a delay, it feels like your site just ghosted them. FID over 100ms? That's the SEO equivalent of left on read.

            <li>Clean up your event handlers—don't make users wait for bloated code to think things through.</li>
            <li>Offload heavy lifting to web workers. They're like interns for your browser.</li>

          CLS is all about visual stability. If your text shifts right as someone's about to click "Buy Now"—and they hit "Delete Account" instead—that's a problem.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Your CLS score should be under 0.1. Otherwise, your site looks like it's powered by caffeine and chaos.

        <div className="bg-amber-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-amber-800 mb-4">✅ CLS Fixes That Actually Work:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-amber-800">
            <li>Always define image and video dimensions. No surprises.</li>
            <li>Reserve space for ads. Don't let them photobomb the layout.</li>
            <li>Never insert content at the top of the page after load. That's betrayal.</li>
            <li>Use transform, not layout-shifting animations. They're smooth and don't ruin lives.</li>
            <li>Preload fonts so your text doesn't do a costume change mid-read.</li>
