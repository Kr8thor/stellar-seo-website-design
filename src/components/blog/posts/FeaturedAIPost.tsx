          Once upon a time, in the kingdom of the Internet, Google was Macbeth - the conniving king but in-charge nevertheless. You wrote a blog post, sprinkled a few keywords into the bubbling pot like SEO glitter, prayed to the algorithm gods, and waited. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. But the process was predictable, like a bad sitcom with a laugh track: Write good stuff, get traffic, convert visitors, make money.
        </BlogParagraph>

        <BlogParagraph>
          That era is officially over. Macbeth is bleeding out on the castle steps. And the assassin? It's ChatGPT. And its friends Gemini, Perplexity, and every other LLM that's rewiring how humans find and trust information.

          <BlogParagraph>
            Google took 13 years to reach a billion users. ChatGPT did it in 2.5. That's not growth. That's a detonation. People are no longer googling "best CRM software." They're telling ChatGPT, "Hey, I run a failing ad agency in Des Moines. Give me three CRMs that won't make me cry blood."
          </BlogParagraph>

          <BlogParagraph className="font-medium">
            And ChatGPT delivers. Fast. Personalized. No ads. No scrolling. No clickbait. Just answers.

        <BlogSection title="The Buyer Journey Isn't a Funnel Anymore. It's a Slingshot.">
          <BlogParagraph>
            You know how we used to woo leads? Ten-step blog funnels. Lead magnets. Nurture emails that made your soul die a little. Not anymore. Today, users go from "I'm vaguely curious" to "I've picked my vendor" in one conversation with an LLM.
          </BlogParagraph>

          <BlogParagraph>
            Asia Frost from HubSpot sees this happening constantly. Actual sales calls where prospects say, "ChatGPT told me you were the best, so I'm here. Let's go." If that doesn't make your marketing team panic-laugh, check their pulse.

          <BlogParagraph>
            SEMrush has data showing that LLM-sourced visitors convert 4 times more than your average organic search clicker. Why? Because these aren't looky-loos. They're pre-qualified by an AI that's already walked them through their problem, vetted options, and nudged them to you.

        <BlogSection title="Your Website Isn't Being Cited. Reddit Is. So Is Some Random Blog Called Kevin's CRM Cave.">
          <BlogParagraph>
            Here's the bad news: Only 9% of LLM results link to vendor sites. That means your lovingly optimized blog probably isn't showing up. Instead, LLMs cite Reddit threads, aggregator sites, and low-authority blogs that happen to be well-structured, specific, and context-rich.
          </BlogParagraph>

          <BlogParagraph className="font-medium">
            The good news? This is a reset. You're no longer competing with million-dollar domain authority. You're competing with specificity. LLMs don't care if you're Forbes or Fred's Funnel Factory. They care if your page nails the context of the query.
