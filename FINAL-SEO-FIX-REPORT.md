## 🎯 **BEFORE VS AFTER COMPARISON**

### **Canonical URLs (Primary Issue Fixed):**
```
🔴 BEFORE: Canonical URLs pointing to redirects
❌ <link rel="canonical" href="https://mardenseo.com/about/"> 
   (Causes 301 redirect to https://mardenseo.com/about)

🟢 AFTER: Canonical URLs pointing to final destinations
✅ <link rel="canonical" href="https://mardenseo.com/about">
   (Direct URL, no redirects)
```

### **Sitemap Quality:**
```
🔴 BEFORE: Sitemap with redirecting URLs
❌ Contains URLs that return 3XX redirects
❌ Non-canonical pages included
❌ Inconsistent trailing slash usage

🟢 AFTER: Clean sitemap with final URLs
✅ Only contains URLs that return 200 status
✅ Only canonical pages included
✅ Consistent URL formatting throughout
```

### **URL Structure:**
```
🔴 BEFORE: Mixed trailing slash usage
❌ https://mardenseo.com/about/     (redirects)
❌ https://mardenseo.com/services/  (redirects)
❌ https://mardenseo.com/contact/   (redirects)

🟢 AFTER: Consistent URL format
✅ https://mardenseo.com/about      (direct)
