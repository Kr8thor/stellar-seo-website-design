```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### **If Sitemap Doesn't Work:**
1. Check React Router is working: test other routes first
2. Verify `/sitemap.xml` route in browser dev tools
3. Check browser network tab for 404 errors
4. Ensure .htaccess uploaded correctly

### **If SEO Features Missing:**
1. Verify SEOProvider is wrapping the app
2. Check React Helmet is installed and working
3. View page source to see meta tags
4. Test with Google's Rich Results Test

## 📱 HOSTING-SPECIFIC NOTES

### **Namecheap cPanel:**
1. Use File Manager to upload `/dist` contents
2. Upload to `public_html` directory
3. Ensure `.htaccess` permissions are 644
4. Check that React Router fallback works

### **File Structure After Upload:**
```
public_html/
├── index.html (main React app entry)
├── assets/ (JS/CSS bundles)
├── .htaccess (React Router + XML config)
├── robots.txt
├── sitemap.xml (static fallback)
├── favicon.ico
