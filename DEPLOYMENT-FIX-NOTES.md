# ðŸš€ DYNAMIC SITEMAP FIX DEPLOYMENT

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the missing dynamic sitemap on the live website by updating the GitHub Actions deployment workflow.

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflow was using `npm run build:integrated` instead of `npm run build:comprehensive`, which meant the dynamic sitemap generator (`generate-production-sitemap.cjs`) was not being executed during deployment.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/github-cpanel-deploy.yml`)
   - Changed build command from `build:integrated` to `build:comprehensive`
   - Added specific verification for dynamic sitemap generation
   - Enhanced logging to show sitemap URL count and content verification

2. **Updated Lovable Configuration** (`package.json`)
   - Changed buildCommand from `build:integrated` to `build:comprehensive`
   - Ensures consistency across all deployment methods

## Expected Results After Next Deployment
- âœ… Dynamic sitemap at https://mardenseo.com/sitemap.xml
- âœ… All blog posts automatically discovered and included
- âœ… Only existing pages included (no 404 errors)
- âœ… Production-safe implementation

## Verification Steps
1. Wait for GitHub Actions workflow to complete (2-3 minutes)
2. Check https://mardenseo.com/sitemap.xml
3. Verify blog posts are included in sitemap
4. Submit updated sitemap to Google Search Console

## Technical Details
- **Dynamic Generator**: `generate-production-sitemap.cjs`
- **Build Script**: `build-comprehensive-static-ssg.mjs`
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions â†’ cPanel Git Integration
- **Safety**: Only scans actual generated files, prevents 404s

**Status**: Fixed and ready for deployment
